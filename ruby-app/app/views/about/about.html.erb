  <h5>Beats</h5>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats">Beats</a> are lightweight data shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts of operational data (think of logs, metrics, or network packet data). The Beats send the
    operational data to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so it can be visualized with Kibana.
  </p>

  <h5>Elastic APM</h5>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.elastic.co/solutions/apm">Elastic APM</a> is an application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack. It uses Elasticsearch as its data store and allows you to monitor software services and applications in real time.
    Regardless of whether your code is best described as a service or as an application, this guide will indiscriminately use the word service.
